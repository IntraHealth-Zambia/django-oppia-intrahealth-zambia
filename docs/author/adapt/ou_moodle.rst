Adpating Open Uni HEAT and OpenWASH Content
===============================================


#. Updating and applying the scripts that we used for the HEAT content adaptation. These remove OU specific stylesheets 
   and navigation. [Describe each script below and what function it performs]

#. Apply more general stylesheet, for example for the in-text questions, notes, warnings - using the same icons etc used 
   for the mobile adapted HEAT content.
   
#. Review of images and tables - to ensure they are resized/styled appropriately for display on mobile

#. Adding activity icons/images

#. Adapt SAQs into Moodle quiz format - not all SAQ questions may be able to be adapted (depends on the complexity and 
   type of question)

#. QA check and review - the QA will focus on the layout/consistency of stylesheets/images/tables etc, but will not look 
   at the actual content, spelling/grammar etc (as assume has already been very well reviewed for these aspects)
